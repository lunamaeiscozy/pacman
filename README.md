<h1> PacMan </h1>
<p>This was an exercise for my course with MIT that recreates the popular game character PacMan with some very basic animation.</p>
<h3>How To Run</h3>
<p>Just drag and drop files onto a browswer. It should load for you. Then press the button to run. </p>

<h3>Roadmap Of Future Improvement</h3>
<p>I'd like to add my own spin to this exercise by adding a color changing ghost that is being chased by pacman.</p>

<h3>License Info</h3>
<p>Lesson materials, code instruction, and images were provided by MIT.</p>
